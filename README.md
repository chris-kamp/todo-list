# todo-list
**An assignment from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/todo-list**

This was the largest project I had attempted so far. In addition to continuing to develop skills in basic HTML, CSS and Javascript, I practised the use of several new techniques and libraries including:
* Node package manager and webpack
* JQuery
* The "PubSub" model and specifically the pubsub-js library
* Selection and manipulation of dates using the js-datepicker and date-fns libraries

I learned a lot about making scaleable, maintainable projects with sensible organisation. I found the use of the PubSub model counter-intuitive initially, but saw how useful it became when adding or modifying features later in the project, which was much easier when there was minimal tight coupling between modules.

There is significant room for improvement and polish, particularly in relation to the visual and design aspects of the page which were not a major focus for me. However, I am leaving this for now to move on to other projects.
